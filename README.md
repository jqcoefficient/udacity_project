The motivation for the project:
  Understand the Seattle market for Aribnb and what factors contribute to the over all rating of each listing. 

The files in the repository:
  * 4-6-Project-Seattle_Airbnb.ipynb: This is the notebook that captures the data exploration of the listing.csv
  * listing.csv: dataset for the data exploration

A summary of the results of the analysis
  * There's a high correlation between value of the rental, cleanliness, and accuracy of the listing to the overall rating.
  * There's a moderate correlation between the checkin process and communication to the overall rating.
  * There's a weak correlation between the location of the listing to the overall rating.
  * Also, there an extremely weak correlation between the host's repsonse rate to the communication score.
  * As expected, there's is positive moderate correlation between the square footage of the listing to the price.
